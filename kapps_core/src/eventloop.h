// EventLoop provides integrations between the kapps libraries and the thread's
// event loop.  The kapps libraries do not mandate a particular event loop
// structure, so these primitives allow us to tie into whatever event loop is
// being used on this thread.
//
// **********
// * Timers *
// **********
//
// EventLoop provides APIs to create timers.  Usually there is a platform API
// suitable for use as a timer source, most common timer APIs conform to the
// requirements below.
//
// Specifically, TimerFactory timers:
// - Use intervals of monotonic time - not wall-clock time
// - Should not include time spent in system suspend/hibernation states
// - Can fire slightly early if the system optimizes timers to minimize wakeups
//   (Some system APIs do this; Qt timers may fire up to 5% early by default)
//
// Both single-shot and recurring timers can be created.  Most platforms have
// specific support for both, and the "default" behavior varies widely (e.g. on
// some platforms a "single-shot" timer is really a recurring timer that's
// automatically canceled, but on other systems a "recurring" timer is really a
// single-shot timer that's automatically rescheduled.  Picking one style would
// be a poor fit for opposite-style systems.)
//
// kapps::core::Timer is implemented with this API.
//
// ***************************
// * File descriptor watches *
// ***************************
//
// On POSIX, EventLoop provides APIs to monitor file descriptors, such as with
// poll(2).  Callers provide their events of interest when creating the watch.
//
// kapps::core::PosixFdNotifier is implemented with this API.
//
// ******************
// * Windows Events *
// ******************
//
// TODO - On Windows, there will be APIs to monitor Events, or in general any
// HANDLE to an object that can be signaled (those listed with
// WaitForMultipleObjectsEx(), etc.)
//
// *******************
// * Implementations *
// *******************
//
// Consumers of kapps libraries should provide an implementation of this
// interface.  Currently, this is mainly only needed on the "main thread" -
// precisely, the one that calls methods of kapps::net::Firewall.  In the future,
// this may be needed on other threads too.
//
// Usually, all elements of the API should be implemented.  In some rare cases,
// intenral auxiliary threads might partially implement this interface when it
// is known that some parts are not needed on that thread.
//
// On POSIX, kapps::core::PollThread auxiliary threads provide an event loop
// and a specific integration.
