// Windows API headers are sensitive both to a inclusion order and to a
// number of macros used to exclude parts of the SDK.
// - NOMINMAX is critical to avoid min() and max() macros
// - Winsock 2 headers must be included before Windows.h to avoid conflicts with
//   Winsock 1.
//
// For internal usage that's not too bad, we would just include <win/winapi.h>
// everywhere we use the Windows SDK instead of the SDK headers.  Unfortunately,
// a handful of Qt headers also include Windows.h (QWindow, QQuickWindow), and
// as a result a number of our own headers have to include win/winapi.h on
// Windows before those headers.
//
// Rather than duplicate this logic over and over in all those headers, this
// winapi.h file is available on all platforms to include SDK headers only on
// Windows.  For win/ sources and headers, there's no difference; they're only
// compiled on Windows anyway.
