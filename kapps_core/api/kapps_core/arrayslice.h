// Many KApps module APIs provide an array of elements as a result, where the
// element type is opaque to the external API (in particular, its size is not
// known).
//
// These arrays are specified with a base pointer (pointer to first element),
// size (count of elements) and stride (byte offset between each element).
// To iterate the list, start with the pointer to the first element, then add
// the stride to reach each subsequent element until reaching the specified
// number of elements.
//
// The base pointer is a const void * because C lacks any mechanism to specify
// it generically; the API documentation will indicate the real type of the
// pointer.
