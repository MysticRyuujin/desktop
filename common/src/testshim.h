// TestShim provides a way to create objects that can be (optionally) mocked in
// unit tests.
//
// Create objects dynamically with TestShim::create().  In normal builds, this
// just creates an object with new and returns it.
//
// In unit test builds, the unit test can install a mock with
// TestShim::installMock().  If the code under test attempts to instantiate the
// mocked class with TestShim::create(), the mock class is instantiated instead.
//
// This is mostly useful when the mocked type has virtual methods that should be
// reimplemented for unit tests, such as to mock out network requests.  It's
// less useful for non-virtual methods, since the code under test will still
// call the real implementation, but it still might be usable if the mocked
// type's constructor can alter the underlying object in some way that's useful
// for unit tests.
//
// The parameters passed to create() are not forwarded to the mock type's
// constructor currently.
