# Block everything from handshake group
# Without this initial block hnsd traffic could possibly travel outside the tunnel (we don't trust the routing table)
block return out group $hnsdGroup flags any no state

# Next, poke a hole in this block but only for traffic on the tunnel (port 13038 is the handshake control port)
pass out proto { tcp, udp } to port { 53, 13038 } group $hnsdGroup flags any no state tag HNSDPKT
# Forcefully route this traffic through the tunnel interface
# We need this to override the macOS split tunnel routing rules
pass out route-to $interface flags any no state tagged HNSDPKT
