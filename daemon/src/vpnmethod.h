// VPNMethod is an interface to a particular method of connecting to the VPN,
// such as OpenVPN, WireGuard, or any future method.
//
// VPNConnection creates a VPNMethod implementation for each connection attempt.
// The VPNMethod implementation should run through one connection attempt and
// emit the appropriate state changes, or any errors, etc.  The implementation
// also provides some context about the connection, such as the tunnel device
// and IP addresses.
//
// VPNMethod implementations may have internal retry strategies for parts of the
// connection, but any failure condition that requires restarting from scratch
// should be handled by VPNConnection - the VPNMethod should just exit in that
// case.

    // The VPN connection proceeds through several states as it is attempted,
    // established, and terminates.
    //
    // The VPN method does not distinguish different types of exits - like
    // connection lost, intentional shutdown, etc.  Instead, VPNConnection
    // determines this based on what it expected VPNMethod to do - any exit that
    // wasn't initiated by VPNConnection is unexpected, etc.
    //
    // (This is more robust than having the individual method indicate different
    // exits.  For example, if VPNConnection intends to shut down the
    // connection, but then an unexpected connection loss happens at the same
    // time, that's fine, just let the connection die.  Or, if VPNMethod
    // errantly thought that a disconnect was intentional, but VPNConnection
    // does not, VPNConnection will correctly re-establish the connection.)
    //
    // VPNMethod only proceeds from earlier states to later states, it can never
    // go back to an earlier state.  However, it can skip states, such as
    // proceeding from Connecting to Exiting (if the connection failed), or
    // from Connecting directly to Exited if a child process crashed, etc.
