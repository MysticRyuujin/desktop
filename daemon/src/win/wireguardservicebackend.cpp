// Firewall notes:
//
// On Windows, the Wireguard embeddable-dll-service normally creates its own
// firewall rules.  We can't rely on them for PIA, because the PIA killswitch
// may remain engaged when the Wireguard service isn't running (during
// connection loss, etc.), and Wireguard's rules are incompatible with PIA
// features such as killswitch settings, Use Existing DNS, Allow LAN, split
// tunnel, etc.
//
// We avoid most of Wireguard's firewall rules:
// - We apply the allowed IPs as 0/1 and 128/1 instead of 0/0, which avoids the
//   killswitch rules (they're incompatible with PIA features such as KS,
//   Allow LAN)
// - We don't pass DNS servers to Wireguard, so it doesn't create DNS server
//   rules.  (PIA applies DNS itself, it just calls netsh, which is all
//   Wireguard does anyway.)
//
// Wireguard still creates a few rules but they're in its own WFP sublayer
// (with sublayer weight 0), and they are all permit rules, so they have no
// effect.  (It creates "permit all on TUN" and "permit Wireguard service" rules
// for both IPv4 and IPv6.)
//
// (In WFP, generally traffic must be allowed or ignored in each sublayer to be
// allowed - a block in any sublayer overrides a permit in any other sublayer.
// Since the Wireguard sublayer contains only "permit" rules, it has no effect.
// This ignores "hard permit" and "veto" actions, but those generally only apply
// when callout drivers are in use.)
