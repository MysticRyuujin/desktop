// WinDnsCacheControl disables or restores the DnsCache service, which is
// necessary to implement split tunnel DNS on Windows.  This is the only way to
// identify DNS traffic per app - disabling the DnsCache service causes apps to
// perform their own DNS.
//
// Microsoft does have documentation indicating that the system can run without
// the DNS cache service:
//   https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/networking/dns/troubleshoot/disable-dns-client-side-caching
//
// However, the documentation is somewhat out of date, the methods listed no
// longer work.  We generally avoid trying to be too "clever" on Windows, but
// there's no other option in this case, and splitting app DNS is important for
// streaming services to work with split tunnel by default.
//
// Permanently disabling the DnsCache service is not an option:
// - It has some side effects besides losing DNS caching: apparently the
//   DnsCache service plays a role in configuring per-adapter DNS.  ipconfig and
//   netsh are unable to display or set DNS servers when DnsCache is disabled.
//   netsh functionality is needed to connect with WireGuard or the OpenVPN
//   'static' method.
// - It requires a system reboot to take effect, this means it's difficult for
//   users to recover if disabling the DNS cache creates a problem.
// - It's fragile - it would be hard to keep track of whether PIA had disabled
//   DnsCache or the user had (some users do this), and it risks causing issues
//   on the user's system that are hard to recover from.
//
// Instead, PIA takes a different approach.  SCM may not let us stop the
// DnsCache service, but we are able to kill the process, and we can temporarily
// replace the service with a stub so it won't come back when SCM tries to
// restart it.  (Note that the system still tries to restart DnsCache on its own
// even if we remove the recovery settings from the service, so we can't
// generally prevent the service from being restarted.)
//
// This avoids making any permanent changes - we can immediately restore the
// original service target, so in the worst case a system restart will restore
// normal behavior.  It also interacts well with users that manually disable
// DnsCache, since we don't have to touch the enabled state of the service.
// It's also simple to implement a recovery failsafe in case PIA would fail to
// restore the default setting, we can easily detect the presence of
// pia-winsvcstub in the DnsCache configuration and restore it.
