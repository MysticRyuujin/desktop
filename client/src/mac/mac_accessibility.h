// The QAccessible implementation on Mac has some very serious limitations that
// prevent it from being usable as-is.  Many state fields and events are simply
// ignored, despite the fact that VoiceOver really needs these events to handle
// all transitions correctly.  There are also many Mac accessibility properties
// that are simply not implemented, despite the relevant information being
// present in QAccessibleInterface (or one of the role-specific interfaces).
//
// In particular:
// - It doesn't forward ObjectCreated and ObjectDestroyed.  This is a major
//   oversight, these are critical to ensure that destroying the control that
//   the VoiceOver cursor is on works correctly.
// - It doesn't implement any table properties, which are critical to get tables
//   to work under VoiceOver.
// - Several roles are not implemented, others simply map to the StaticText and
//   Group roles, even when more specific NSAccessible roles would make more
//   sense.
// - The scroll bar orientation property is not implemented; all scroll bars
//   appear to be horizontal.  (Trivial to implement, but very annoying.)
//
// Some of these features are critical to get VoiceOver to work with the app,
// so we resort to poking some of the internals in order to fill them in.
// Fortunately, the dynamic nature of Objective-C lets us do this at runtime.
