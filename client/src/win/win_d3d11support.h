// Enumerate the D3D adapters on the system and select one that supports feature
// level 11.0.  Qt Quick's D3D11 backend requires an adapter supporting 11.0,
// but isn't smart enough to actually pick one - it uses the default feature
// level list, which will fall back as far as 9.1.
//
// Only the index is really needed to set up the Qt Quick backend, but this
// stores information about all the adapters observed so it can be traced (this
// detection has to occur before Logger is set up, so we have to trace later,
// see main.cpp).
