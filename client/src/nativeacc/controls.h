// Several of these types are just AccessibleItems with a role and no other
// properties.
//
// It's still preferable to define these each as distinct attached types, rather
// than actually define roles from QML, because it makes the QML code clearer
// and more concise.
//
// Unfortunately, the moc still requires a lot of this to be spelled out, we
// can't factor it down any further due to QML registered types requiring
// Q_OBJECT.

// Text and Label are used for static text items.  They have the StaticText
// accessibility role.
//
// These types of elements are similar, but not identical:
// - Text is used for "free text" statics, like messages or explanations.  These
//   aren't associated with a neighboring control.  (This annotation appears on
//   all platforms.)
// - Label is used for labels associated with a neighboring control, when that
//   control's title is set to the same text as a label.
//   - On Mac OS only, these elements are hidden.  VoiceOver already reads the
//     control titles, and having these elements also makes navigation somewhat
//     more cumbersome.  This also improves navigation on the Connection page
//     and the IP/Usage tiles; these use column layouts that VoiceOver doesn't
//     read in the right order.
//   - Other platforms do not reliably read control titles, but statics are
//     skipped by default since Narrator/NVDA/Orca all use Tab navigation as
//     their "usual" navigation style, and statics are not tab stops.
//
// Subtle as this is, it's still important to use the correct control type in
// the correct context.
//
// Note that neither of these types are used for "indicator" texts that change
// often (such as he IP address displays, download speed displays, etc.) - those
// should use TextField instead (usually via the ValueText/ValueHtml common
// type.)
//
// Typically, for a static text, the name is the displayed text.  Static texts
// don't normally need a description.
//
// NOTE: StaticText elements report as "editable text" in Windows with Qt
// 5.11.1; fixed in 5.11.2.  https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-69894
