// WindowScaler is used in QML to size a QtQuick.Window at a logical size
// independent of the screen DPI.
//
// On OS X, this just sizes the window to the logical size, because the OS
// handles scaling for us.  On Windows however, scaling for per-monitor DPI
// support is incredibly complex.
//
// The QML window should create a WindowScaler targeting the QtQuick.Window and
// set the logicalSize property to the desired window size.  The QML code must
// *NOT* set or bind the Window's size properties, but it can (and should) read
// them to find out the window's actual client size.
//
// The window must then size its contents to the actual window size, such as:
// - by using an Item wrapping the entire content of the window at the logical
//   size that scales to the window size
// - using only relative layout and sizing for components inside the window
// - by applying the window's scale factor (the scale property, which is the
//   actual size / logical size) to the components' layout metrics.
//
// The logicalSize can be updated to resize the window.
