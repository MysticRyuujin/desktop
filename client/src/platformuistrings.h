// This file defines UI strings for platform-specific code.
// These are here so they always end up in *.ts files, even when not building on
// that platform.
//
// TODO: We need to find a better solution for this.  Some possibilities
// include:
// - Don't update the in-tree *.ts files on build, instead collect the updated
//   files as build artifacts and check them in once they're translated.  We
//   could leave translatable strings in platform files; we'd have to combine
//   all the build artifacts for the various platform builds in a
//   post-processing step.
// - Find a way to include all platform source files in the `lupdate` run
//   without compiling them.  It's possible to do this in the QBS script, but
//   `lupdate` seems to have issues parsing the Windows source files (it
//   consistently issues nuisance errors on Mac, it issues them inconsistently
//   on Windows).
// - Find a way to prevent `lupdate` from removing strings from the in-tree
//   files during the build.  Maybe just run `lupdate` to generate the build
//   artifact *.ts files, then integrate the new strings into the in-tree files
//   in a post-processing step.
