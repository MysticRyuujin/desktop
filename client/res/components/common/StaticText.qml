// StaticText is a Text that has a StaticText accessible role, and sets its name
// to the displayed text.
//
// This should only be used with plain text - don't use HTML in accessibility
// annotations.  (StaticHtml can be used if the markup is simple and removable.)
//
// This control is for fixed text that rarely changes and is not associated with
// a nearby control (such as the message in MessageWithLinks, the changelog
// text, etc.)  For other uses:
// - Use LabelText for a fixed text that labels a nearby control (that has
//   the label text as its own name)
// - Use ValueText for a "value indicator" text that changes frequently
