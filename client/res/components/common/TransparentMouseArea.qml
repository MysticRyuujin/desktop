// TransparentMouseArea is a MouseArea that propagates all events up to other
// MouseAreas higher in the stacking order.
//
// It's intended to be used when a specific element of a control should have a
// hover effect (like an InfoTip), but clicks are still passed through to a
// parent.
//
// Note that if the parent has hover effects, those should usually still be
// applied, and MouseArea does not offer a way to propagate hover events.  (The
// parent just has to check both MouseAreas' containsMouse flags.)
