// ButtonArea is a MouseArea that supports keyboard navigation and screen
// reading hints, which are tuned for a MouseArea that acts like a button.
//
// ButtonArea is mostly a drop-in replacement for a MouseArea used as a button.
// A few additional properties are needed for screen reading.
//
// ButtonArea forwards some properties of MouseArea directly, such as
// acceptedButtons, hoverEnabled, etc.  Others, such as containsMouse and
// the clicked() signal, are hooked up to provide access via the keyboard as
// well.  See the properties below for details.
//
// There are no signals for other signals of MouseArea, like doubleClicked(),
// positionChanged(), etc.  If you need these signals, you should use a
// MouseArea and implement your own keyboard navigation, keeping in mind that
// hover/drag functionality needs to be reasonably accessible with the keyboard.
//
// Keep in mind that ButtonArea displays an OutlineFocusCue when focused, so its
// stacking order and positioning are important for that cue to appear properly.

  // Screen reading properties.  These must be set for a ButtonArea, or it won't
  // be properly interpreted by screen readers.
  //
  // The name and description both describe the button.  Generally, the name is
  // the text displayed by the button.  Don't include the type of the control
  // (in either name or description), this is indicated with 'role'.
  //
  // Most buttons are fine with just a name.  If the name is not clear on its
  // own, or does not capture state that's expressed visually, the description
  // provides a slightly longer description of the button.
