// GenericButtonArea is a MouseArea that supports keyboard navigation tuned for
// a MouseArea that acts like a button.
//
// This is used to implement ButtonArea and CheckButtonArea.  Most of the time,
// use one of these instead, since they also provide accessibility annotations.
//
// GenericButtonArea could be used directly for unusual buttons that require
// custom screen reading annotations, but consider extracting that to a reusable
// ButtonArea-like component instead.

  // Properties of the MouseArea that can be used directly.  ButtonArea can be
  // configured for any mouse buttons / cursor shape, like MouseArea.
  //
  // Most properties should work, more could be added here.  The MouseArea is
  // hidden mainly to prevent mistaken connections to its clicked() signal.
  // (Note that 'enabled' and 'visible' are also availble as properties from
  // Item that apply to its children by default.)

  // These properties are _not_ forwarded:
  // - drag, mouseX, mouseY, pressAndHoldInterval, pressedButtons,
  //   preventStealing, propagateComposedEvents, scrollGestureEnabled
  // Most of these don't make much sense for a ButtonArea, like dragging-related
  // properties.  There isn't a clear way to model those in general with the
  // keyboard.  If you need those, you should probably use a MouseArea directly
  // and implement custom keyboard navigation.

  // These properties model the corresponding ones of MouseArea:

  // containsPress is enabled for a real mouse button press, or for a key press.
  // It's still a shortcut for containsMouse && pressed.
  readonly property bool containsPress: containsMouse && pressed
  // containsMouse is enabled either when the area actually contains the mouse
  // _or_ when it is showing the keyboard focus cue.  This triggers hover
  // effects, which are sensible to show when focusing with the keyboard.
  //
  // Keep in mind that it's possible for more than one ButtonArea to have
  // containsMouse=true - one can be keyboard-focused while the other is
  // pointed.
  readonly property bool containsMouse: mouseArea.containsMouse || focusCue.show || inKeyPress
  // pressed is enabled either for a real mouse button press or for a key press.
  readonly property bool pressed: mouseArea.pressed || inKeyPress

  // clicked() is emitted when the ButtonArea is clicked _or_ when it is
  // activated with the keyboard.  It does _not_ provide a MouseEvent like
  // MouseArea, since it could originate from the keyboard.
  signal clicked()

  // There are no signals for double click, drag, hold, wheel, etc.  These don't
  // fit the ButtonArea model - if you need these, consider using a MouseArea
  // and providing custom keyboard navigation.
  //
  // entered() and exited() could be provided based on the combined
  // containsMouse state; these are not provided right now just because they
  // aren't used.

  // Some focus cue properties can be overridden, such as to change the color
  // (in the header) or put the border on the inside.

  //
  // This is important for a few cases, such as the header menu button, because
  // activating on 'press' would allow the 'release' event to go to the first
  // menu item and immediately activate it.  (MenuItem isn't smart enough to
  // realize that it didn't get the corresponding 'press' event.)
  //
  // Additionally, we show 'press' effects while the key is down.

  // inKeyPress is set to the key that was pressed when a press event occurs.
  // If it's still set when the key release event occurs, we activate the
