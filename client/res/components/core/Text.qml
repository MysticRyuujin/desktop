// Text tweaks:
// - Don't mirror the text itself for RTL
// - Don't detect alignment from text content, just left-align by default and
//   reverse the alignment for RTL
QtQuick.Text {
  id: coreText

  // Always left-align by default.  (This can be overridden when right- or
  // center-aligned text is needed.)
  //
  // The default Text behavior would be to detect based on the content - for
  // Arabic, the text would become right-aligned.
  //
  // This is useless (for us at least) for several reasons:
  // - It depends on the Text object being laid out in a specific way - it has to
  //   actually be sized to the area in which it's aligned, which isn't the
  //   default (by default its width is its implicitWidth and horizontal
  //   alignment has no effect).
  // - It doesn't always match the UI layout direction.  We display non-Arabic
  //   text in RTL (which should still be right-aligned), and Arabic text in LTR
  //   (the Arabic selection in the Language drop-down, which should be left-
  //   aligned).
  //
  // Instead, always left-align by default.  UI mirroring (if/when that's
  // supported) will flip this correctly because it's an explicit binding.
  //
  // Regardless of horizontal alignment, reverse the alignment for RTL.
  // We do _not_ do this with LayoutMirroring.enabled, because that also
  // reverses anchors, ugh.
  //
  // Instead, manually reverse the alignment if it's left or right and mirroring
  // is enabled.  The "effectiveHorizontalAlignment" property still works
  // normally.

  // The implementation of the alignment tweaks involves some aliases in order
  // to hide the real 'horizontalAlignment' property.  Bindings should refer to
  // 'horizontalAlignment' normally.

  // binding here and bind the real property of Text itself.  However, this
  // does not seem to work; the binding is just silently ignored (it doesn't set
  // _either_ property).  Even the sample code on the linked page does this if
  // you actually try to run it.
  //
  // Using a second alias to reach the real property does work though.
